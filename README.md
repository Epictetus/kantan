# kantan - simple deployment

kantan is a tool that automates deployment of apps via containers (like Heroku).

It is *very much* a work in progress - feel free to check it out, but don't expect it to fully work yet.

If this sounds interesting, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:me@jacobwg.com).

The name comes from the Japanese word for simple and easy, 簡単 (kantan).
